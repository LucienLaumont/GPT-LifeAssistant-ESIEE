    "\n",
    "Using Phi-2 for dataset generation is a strategic choice for our student project, given our limited resources and small team of three. As students, we lack the financial means to access large-scale AI infrastructure, so we must find a balance between quantity and quality to ensure we have enough data to fine-tune our model effectively. Phi-2, being a lightweight yet capable language model, allows us to generate a high volume of structured instructional data without requiring access to expensive high-end GPUs. By carefully designing prompts and filtering the generated output, we aim to maintain quality while maximizing the number of examples, ensuring that our model is trained on a dataset that is both diverse and relevant. This approach enables us to push the limits of what can be achieved with minimal resources, making AI research accessible even to small student-led initiatives like ours.\n"

    "**Why using a GPU ?**\n",
    "\n",
    "We used a GPU to speed up the dataset generation process. Since Phi-2 is a Transformer-based model, running it on a CPU would be significantly slower, making it impractical to generate a large dataset efficiently. The GPU allows for faster text generation, reducing waiting times and enabling us to produce more data in less time, which is crucial given our limited resources and need for scalability."
